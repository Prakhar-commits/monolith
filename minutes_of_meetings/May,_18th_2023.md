Siddhant taught us Flask and decorators in python3.
We need to build user authentication so they can comment on blogs. After comparing Firebase and Appwrite we make a conclusion to use JWT for authentication with Firebase. We discussed what database should we use like SQL or NoSQL, and what CSS framework should we use like Tawilwind or Bootstrap. Since we are using React JS on the frontend we will be using material UI that will give us some built-in components. There will be a feature blog and testimonials on the landing page. We finalised the design of the blogging page other than the landing page.

### Next Task

- Start coding landing page, blogging page, and DSA cheat sheet.
